          Mostly a builder and developer in the digital sphere; and a writer, researcher, and inhabitant of history and the arts &amp; culture space. (The tech industry pays me. I am an eternal student of the humanities.)

          Since graduating from the University of Manchester (History), I have briefly bounced around, landing in the Netherlands. Here, I've had the opportunity of being the first employee of two start-ups (extreme education). I've helped career-changers learn how to code with the New York Code + Design Academy. I was one of the first developers at e-bike company, VanMoof. Currently, I am a software engineer for adidas. 👟
