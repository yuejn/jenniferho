      <h1>Hello! I'm Jennifer.</h1>

      <p>I'm a historian turned developer. I build digital products and help with strategy. After years of building websites and apps, I have a penchant for cutting through nonsense â€” be it in products, processes, and writing.</p>

      <p>Previously, I worked at VanMoof, making e-bikes smarter; learned about startup strategy at The Next Web; helped teach career changers web development at The New York Code + Design Academy; and won a European Youth Award as the lead developer for a higher education meetup platform.</p>

      <p><a href="work.html" title="Work">A list of previous projects and writing experience.</a></p>

      <p>I'm currently <strong>available</strong> for freelancing. Can I help you? Reach out! :)</p>
