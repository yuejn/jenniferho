            <h3><a href="https://yuejn.com/amsterdam/">New Amsterdammer Handbook</a></h3>

            <p>I moved to Amsterdam in 2016 and, since then, have been keeping notes on two things: how to move here, and how to live here. The first is about official matters, logistics, and how to find an affordable bedroom in a houseshare. The second is about navigating day-to-day life. What is happening in the city? What’s the best way to save money on museums, theatre, music, and movies?</p>

            <p>In the past, I’ve been used to sending newcomers a private link which was then shared around. I had only intended it to be 'single-use', so now it’s online for people to checkout.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3><a href="https://localcivics.io">Local</a></h3>

            <p>Local is an education technology platform that gamifies civic participation and empowers students and educators to amplify their social impact in their communities.</p>

            <p>For demo purposes, I built the first prototype of Local with Ruby on Rails and vanilla HTML and CSS. On top of this, we extended it with a small API so we could leverage scraped data of relevant events across Brooklyn.</p>

            <h3>VanMoof Blog</h3>
            <p><em>This is a project I was part of when I was a full-time employee of VanMoof, an e-bikes company.</em></p>

            <p>In late 2017, I was given a project that combined my passion for stories and platforms. For a slower marketing venture, we wanted to produce evergreen content on the topic of cities and cycling to position ourselves as a leader in that space. As lead editor, I worked with local writers to create positive longform content, and commissioned artists to bring their stories to life.</p>

            <p>The platform was designed and developed by a third-party agency with comprehensive feedback. (I hope that my experience as a developer, made that feedback a little easier to understand!)</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>VanMoof Outlet</h3>
            <p><em>This is a project I was part of when I was a full-time employee of VanMoof, an e-bikes company.</em></p>

            <p>I coordinated two online outlet sales, bringing together multiple teams across the company on tight deadlines. I was responsible for connecting the platform we used, Shopify, to our own financial (Adyen) and warehousing (Odoo) systems, as well as: streamlining processes like handling cancellations and refunds; making the online shop clear and responsive for mobile users; and allowing customers to purchase an add-on accessory, warranty, on a small set of bikes through some templating hacking. This modification accounted for 5% of €1,5 million revenue over two years.</p>

          <h1>Writing</h1>

          <p>I don’t write publicly as much as I (apparently) should. I like to proofread and edit though — making sure messages are clear and consistent.</p>

          <p>In 2016, I interned for a media compay in the tech space. I started with posts highlighting new startups in so-and-so space (like fintech and renewable energy), then my colleague and I initiated an interview series where we talked with early-stage startup founders. We wanted to hear about their approach, their strategy, and their drive. Like this one, a profile on Polarsteps which reached 20,000 users on a zero dollar marketing budget: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/04/25/polarsteps-koen-droste/">A Dutchman sails across the Atlantic and innovates travel logging.</a></p>
